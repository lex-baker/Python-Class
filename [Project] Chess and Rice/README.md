# The Chess Problem

This program calculates how many grains of rice the mathematician would have in the Chess Problem

The type of rice is assumed to be brown rice

Finding sources on the volume of brown rice:

-This source claims 1200 grains of rice is roughly equivalent to 180mL
-

-This wikipedia article on orders of magnitude give rough ideas for volume of both small and long grains of rice
-Small (2mm wide and 5mm long) = 2e-8 m^3
-Large (3mm wide and 12mm long) = 7e-8 m^3
-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(volume)


1 cubic meter = 1,000 liters = 1,000,000 (1e6) milliliters 
Average of 2e-8 and 7e-8 = 4.5e-8
(2e-8 m^3) * (1200 grains) * (1e6 mL  /  1 m^3) = 24 mL (solid block)
(4.5e-8 m^3) * (1200 grains) * (1e6 mL  /  1 m^3) = 
(7e-8 m^3) * (1200 grains) * (1e6 mL  /  1 m^3) = 84 mL (solid block)


Measure of THings claims the average weight of a grain of rice is 0.021 grams

Another source says that 1 cup of uncooked, long grain, brown rice is equal to 210 grams

210 / 0.021 = 10,000 grains of rice in a cup

(7e-8 m^3) * (4226.75 cups / m^3) = 2.96e-4 cups per single grain of rice
2.96e-4 cups per grain of rice * 10,000 grains = 2.959 cups of rice (solid block?)
2.959 cups of rice (solid) - (2.959 * 0.15) = 2.51 cups of rice (With 15% void)


So 10,000 grains of rice is somewhere between 1 and 2.5 cups of rice

So it can be assumed that with voids, 10,000 grains of rice is equivalent to 1.75 cups of rice
