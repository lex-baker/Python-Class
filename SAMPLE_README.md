README.txt

The following details the contents of a typical README.txt file that must accompany any programming 
assignments that are submitted for grading.  The document IS NOT A WORD DOCUMENT it is a simple 
text file, like those that would be created using NOTEPAD or similar text editor (note: your IDE is a 
glorified text editor and can be used to create your readme.txt).  To reiterate DO NOT USE A WORD 
PROCESSOR to write your file, do not submit a PDF, docx, doc, rtf, image or other file type.  
Your readme.txt is a detailed description of what the program is designed to do, and how to execute the 
code.  It should detail how input files should be formatted and where output will be directed (e.g. file, 
screen, or printer). Include the following topics (use these titles in your document):

TITLE: [required]
AUTHOR/PROGRAMMER: Lex Baker
DATE DUE: [required]
DATE SUBMITTED: [required]
COURSE TITLE: Python I
MEETING TIME(S): Monday, Wednesday, Friday @ 9am
DESCRIPTION: [required]
HONOR CODE: [required] digitally signed
HOWTO: [required] how to execute the file
INPUT FILE: [required, if used] include structure, formatting, naming, and so on.
OUTPUT FILE: [required, if used] name, data type, device, where appropriate, 
BIBLIOGRAPHY: [required] include any websites, books, et cetera, that you referenced to aide 
you in completing your work. This would include your textbook.
RESOURCES: beyond a typical bibliography
TUTORS: individuals other that the instructor that gave you support
COMMENTS: e.g. version numbers, assumptions, known errors, limitations, and 
bonus/enhancements made to the assignment.  Also include here any discussions and provisions 
you may have negotiated with the instructor, such as extensions.  If a program is turned in late, 
you must use this section to explain why in order to earn (late) credit for your effort.
REFLECTION: [required] the length of time it took you to complete this assignment. Include any 
problems that you encountered and how you overcame them.

All entries should be included in each readme.txt.  For those items that do not apply and are not tagged 
[required] mark the entry NA (not applicable).  Submit the readme.txt along with your source code, data 
files, documentation, et cetera as a single compressed (zipped, gzipped) file.
