COMMENTS: I turned this assignment in a day late because I was mistaken about the due date. I didn't look closely enough at the day, and thought it was due Sunday night, not Friday. In addition, this program cannot divide by zero, because of the input validation for every input that needed to be 1-10. Because of those 1-10 inputs being on the bottom, and the 'hours needed' (P_N) variable must be greater than 1 (and is checked), the denominator can never equal zero.
REFLECTION: This assignment took me less then 2 hours, most of which was working through the input validation.
