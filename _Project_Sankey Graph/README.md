DESCRIPTION: This program creates a sankey graph to represent data from a text file. The user must input the filename, and the program will generate and save the diagram.
HONOR CODE: On my honor, I neither gave nor receieved unauthorized help on this assignment. <Lex Baker>
HOWTO: Open this file in the IDE of your choice and run. Make sure to have the file you are trying to use in the same directory.
INPUT FILE: Baseball.txt, California_Electricity.txt, MiniatureGolf.txt. The graphics.py module is also used.
OUTPUT FILE: [filename].ps
BIBLIOGRAPHY: Canvas Page
RESOURCES: N/A
TUTORS: N/A
COMMENTS: The code is explained in comments within the sankey.py file. Additionally, I attempted the extra credit portion of creating a help message for users when they enter --help or an incorrect filename.
REFLECTION: This assignment took me around 15 hours to complete. I was able to expand upon my work from last year, and measure how much I've grown by the difference int he quality of code between the two projects.
